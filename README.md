When opening the app the user is shown the title of the app along with the current date.
When you scroll down the planner is broken up by hour timeblocks representing each hour a business is open.
When viewing the timeblocks, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
You can enter an event for each timeblock and it will save the event to local storage so when you refresh the page you will still see the events.
